"""A thin, measured layer over genlayer-py 0.18 for StudioNet.

Used by scripts/demo.py. Everything here was checked against the installed SDK
rather than a docs page, and the receipt reading follows what Recourse measured
on the same network:

  * the genlayer CLI's `write` has no way to attach value to a call, so a
    payable method is called through genlayer-py, whose write_contract takes
    `value`;
  * genlayer-py 0.18's fund_account() refuses every chain but localnet, so the
    StudioNet faucet is called as the RPC method it is, sim_fundAccount, and
    the balance is read before and after, because the faucet's answer is not
    evidence of anything;
  * ACCEPTED and FINALIZED say the committee agreed, not that the contract
    returned. A refusal is agreed on too. Success is a leader result whose
    status is "return", and a refusal is the payload of a "rollback".

Accounts are made in memory for one run and never written anywhere. They hold
StudioNet test GEN from StudioNet's own faucet and nothing else.
